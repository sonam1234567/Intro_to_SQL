1. All the datasets are not getting imported in mysql if we try to import it using the csv extension file.
-> Solution: We need to import the data sets in json extension file.

2. All the json files data are imported as only text.
-> Solution: Inorder to convert all the column to their respective data type first we need to convert the text 'Null' to null.
for example:
update tablename
set date = null where date = 'Null';
The above query will track all the 'Null' string in the column date and convert it to null value.
After doing so we can convert the date text to date data type.

3. After all the null values are taken care of we need to convert data to it's respective data types.
->Solution
Alter table world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
modify column funds_raised_millions INT;
